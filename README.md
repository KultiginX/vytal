# vytal
In the context of a Master Thesis, I worked with Vytal (https://www.vytal.org/) together.
This repository follows the chapter of the thesis. The master's thesis text and the colloquium presentation have been also uploaded.
The Jupyter file start with 02_Discovery should be run first since it returns 3 python objects (data frames) that are being used in the following Jupyter files. 
The first two digits in the name of a file represents the corresponding chapter in the thesis. The following digits after the underscore represents the sections. If this section notated as _00_, then it is an auxiliary section which is actually not a part of the thesis text, but a preperation work for the other sections. 
Due to the confidentiality, company data is not uploaded.
