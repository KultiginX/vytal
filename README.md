# vytal
In the context of a Master Thesis, I worked with Vytal (https://www.vytal.org/) together.
This repository follows the chapter of the thesis. 
The Jupyter file start with 02_Discovery should be run first since it returns 3 python objects (data frames) that are being used in the following files. 
The first two digits in the name of a file represents the corresponding chapter in the thesis. The following digits after the underscore represents the sections. If this section notated as _00_, then it is an auxiliary section which is actually not a part of the thesis text, but a preperation work for the other sections. 
Due to the limitations in Github some files larger than 100mb cannot be pushed into the repo. 
Data is confidential.
